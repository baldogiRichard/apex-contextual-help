This repository contains the files for the APEX Contextual Help Plug-in.

Oracle Application Express - Contextual Help Plugin

This plug-in creates a dynamic action which helps to explore and drive the user in the site with contextual help dialogs.

Minimum requirement: Oracle Application Expresss 24.2

This plug-in uses the <a href="https://github.com/bumbeishvili/org-chart" rel="nofollow">Driver.js</a> library.

# setup

You can check each setup in my downloadable <a href="https://github.com/baldogiRichard/plug-in-site" rel="nofollow">Sample Application: APEX Plug-ins by Richard Baldogi</a>

This DA is a little bit a specific one because the only thing you need to do is to configure the "Initialization JS Function", so it will output a JSON object to the main function which will initialize the Driver object accordingly.
For valid JSON formats and properties please check out the <a href="https://driverjs.com/docs/basic-usage" rel="nofollow">Driver.js Documentation</a>.
